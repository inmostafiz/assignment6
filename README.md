1️⃣ What is the difference between var, let, and const?
var → Old way of declaring variables. It is function-scoped and can be re-declared or updated.

let → New way, introduced in ES6. It is block-scoped and can be updated but not re-declared in the same scope.

const → Also block-scoped, but you cannot update or re-declare it (the value stays constant).

2️⃣ What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?

map() → Loops through an array and returns a new array with modified values.

forEach() → Loops through an array but does not return a new array. It’s just for running some code on each element.

filter() → Loops through an array and returns a new array with only the elements that match a condition.

3️⃣ What are arrow functions in ES6?

Arrow functions are a shorter and cleaner way to write functions. They make your code look simpler and also handle the this keyword in a smarter way.

4️⃣ How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

Destructuring lets you unpack values from arrays or objects directly into variables. This makes your code shorter and easier to read.

5️⃣ Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?

Template literals use backticks instead of quotes, allowing you to insert variables directly inside strings and also write multi-line strings more easily.
